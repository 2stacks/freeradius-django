#  hints
#
#	The hints file.  This file is used to match
#	a request, and then add attributes to it.  This
#	process allows a user to login as "bob.ppp" (for example),
#	and receive a PPP connection, even if the NAS doesn't
#	ask for PPP.  The "hints" file is used to match the
#	".ppp" portion of the username, and to add a set of
#	"user requested PPP" attributes to the request.
#
#	Matching can take place with the the Prefix and Suffix
#	attributes, just like in the "users" file.
#	These attributes operate ONLY on the username, though.
#
#	Note that the attributes that are set for each entry are
#	NOT added to the reply attributes passed back to the NAS.
#	Instead they are added to the list of attributes in the
#	request that has been SENT by the NAS.
#
#	This extra information can be used in the users file to
#	match on. Usually this is done in the DEFAULT entries,
#	of which there can be more than one.
#
#	In addition a matching entry can transform a username
#	for authentication purposes if the "Strip-User-Name"
#	variable is set to Yes in an entry (default is Yes).
#
#	A special non-protocol name-value pair called "Hint"
#	can be set to match on in the "users" file.
#
#	As with the "users" file, the first entry that matches the
#	incoming request will cause the server to stop looking for
#	more hints. If the "Fall-Through" attribute is set to
#	"Yes" in an entry then the server will not stop, but
#	continue to process further hints from the file. Matches
#	on subsequent hints will be against the altered request
#	from the previous hints, not against the original request.
#
#	The following is how most dial-up ISPs want to set this up.
